# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is a placeholder for an argument, which is the actual value to be evaluated in the function. 

Researched answer: A parameter is a placeholder that is defined in the function expression. The placeholder is then assigned an argument. The argument is the actual value that is passed through the function invocation. The importance of parameters and arguments in functions is making them dynamic and maintaining encapsulation. 

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: An object is a collection data type, similar to arrays. A class is the blueprint for an object.

Researched answer: Objects are a collection of data types consisting of key:value pairs. Keys are the symbol data type, and values can be any recognizable data type in Javascript. Objects can hold both static data and logic known as methods, making them the intersection of data and behavior. Classes are templates for objects, containing both data and behavior. Similar to functions, classes are reusable. 

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is the repitition of an action over and over again until a condition is met. 

Researched answer: Iteration is the process of performing an action a given number of times, or until a condition is met. A for loop is an example of iteration in Javascript. 

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Researched answer: Hoisting is one way Javascript helps developers out; it refers to the way in which Javascript will automatically move a variable declaration to the top. Even though Javascript reads from top to bottom, hoisting allows the developer to use the variable in code above the declaration without receiving an error. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Spread operator: The spread operator looks like (...). It is used in React to copy/paste all or part of an existing object or array into another object or array. It is often used in conjunction with destructuring.

2. React: React was created by the developers behind Facebook. As Facebook grew, they needed to scale the application to allow for more and more users. React is a Javascript library, consisting of node modules and managed by Yarn. Benefits of React include the reusable manner its code is structured, and how efficiently it handles user interaction. 

3. JSX: JSX is a markdown syntax extension of Javascript. JSX uses a combination of Javascript and HTML to allow users in React to build user interfaces.
